v0.1.0
  - Features
    + A simple procedurally generated map with rooms, corridors and doors
    + Player character that can move around the map
    + Field of view for the player character
    + Collision detected with walls
    + Ligth sources and light/dark areas on the map

  - Algorithms implemented:
    + Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) algorithm for map generation
    + Breath First Search / Dijkstra / A* algorithms
      + Used for pathfinding (BFS/A*) and lightmap generation (Dijkstra map)
    + Symmetric shadowcasting algorithm
      + Used to calculate field of view
